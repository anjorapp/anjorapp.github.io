        <p align="justify"><?=$co['name'];?> (henceforth known as "<?=$co['shortname'];?>") has established this Privacy Policy so that you know how we collect your information, if at all, the method in which we use and protect your personal information, and to highlight our commitment to have reasonable protective measures to ensure that there is no loss, misuse or alteration of your ‘information’, in our control, voluntarily. 
		</p>
		
        <p align="justify"><?=$co['name'];?> is committed to respecting your online privacy and has processes in place to protect personal information you share with us. We are now, and commit to be in the future, sensitive to your privacy issues. 
		</p>
		<strong>Personal Identifying Information</strong>
		 <p align="justify">"Personal Identifying Information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact or locate the person to whom such information pertains, which we might collect and maintain, subject to the terms and conditions, especially the Disclaimer as enunciated below, and which will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection.
		</p>
		<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
		 <p align="justify"><?=$co['name'];?> does not suo-moto collect personally-identifying information about you unless you voluntarily submit that information to us through this site, by email, or by other means. To illustrate, if you send us an email enquiring about our products and services, we may need to gather information from you with regards to your name, mailing address, telephone number and/or e-mail address in order to respond to your inquiries.
		</p>
		
		<p align="justify">When you visit our website, we may automatically collect certain non-identifying information about you, such as the domain name that referred you to our site, the type of browser or computer operating system you use, and navigational information. We collect this non-identifying information internally, to help us analyze the effectiveness of and to enhance the usefulness of our marketing efforts. Our website uses Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the Internet (it is a "dynamic" address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, it is possible that your IP Address that we collect, or even perhaps a cookie we use, may contain information that could be deemed personally identifiable. This is because with some broadband connections your IP Address doesn’t change (it is "static") and could be associated with your personal computer. We may use your IP address to report aggregate information on use and to help improve our website.
		</p>
		<p align="justify">Forms on our website require you to provide accurate contact information, which helps us deliver a high quality of service. By checking the box on the registration form and submitting your details, you are indicating your consent to receiving marketing emails from us and personally identifiable information that you provide (such as name, email address, telephone number) may be used to send you information about our company, product and services, special offers, and newsletters. To view or modify information previously submitted, or to opt out of receiving future communications, click the personalized link provided at the bottom of the email communication you receive.
		</p>
		<strong>What are cookies?</strong>
		 <p align="justify">A cookie is a small file created on your computer by a Web server, which can be referenced when that website is visited. Cookies cannot access files or other information stored on your computer. There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are used during a single website visit and are automatically deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies are used to track website activity over a longer period, and remain on your computer until either you choose to delete them or they expire.
		</p>
		<strong>How does <?=$co['name'];?> use cookies?</strong>
		 <p align="justify"><?=$co['name'];?> uses persistent cookies in several places on our website so we can pre-populate forms to improve your ease of use. For example, the information provided during a brochure download is captured so that you do not need to enter it again when requesting additional documents. <?=$co['name'];?> may also use persistent cookies to collect analytical information about how visitors use our website. For example, we may measure website usage, access to online services, and the level of interest in particular products. We use this information to improve our service and provide a better experience for visitors to our website.
		</p>
		 <p align="justify">Currently, we do not use cookies to collect information about identifiable individuals or use cookie information to offer products and services to individuals. If this changes in the future, we will update this section.
		</p>
		<p align="justify"><?=$co['name'];?> never uses cookies to track your Internet use after you leave the <?=$co['name'];?> website.
		</p>
		<strong>Do I have to accept cookies?</strong>
		 <p align="justify">Depending on the Web browser you use, you may be able to configure it to accept session cookies but disable persistent cookies. If you do this, you will be able to use the <?=$co['name'];?> website, but your browser will not remember your personal preferences when you return to the site (e.g. download forms will not be pre-filled). If you use Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox or Netscape Navigator for Windows, you can follow the instructions in the toolbar on your browser to accept session cookies but disable persistent cookies.
		</p>
		<strong>Disclosure to Third Parties</strong>
		 <p align="justify"><?=$co['name'];?> does not sell such Personally-Identifying Information and any voluntary disclosure to any party which is not a part of the <?=$co['name'];?> Group shall be made only after your consent for the same has been obtained, unless such disclosure is required to be made by the Legislature, Judiciary or Executive of any Country. However <?=$co['name'];?> may transfer personal information to a third party who provides services for <?=$co['name'];?>, such as the distribution of our newsletter and other <?=$co['name'];?> publications. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services and under the supervision of <?=$co['name'];?>.
		</p>

		 <p align="justify">You should be aware that this site is not intended for use by, or designed to attract, individuals under the age of 13. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is an individual under the age of 13. By using this website, you hereby declare, that you are over 13 years of age.
		</p>
		<strong>Links</strong>
		 <p align="justify">This site may contain links to other websites. <?=$co['name'];?> is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites.

It shall be onerous upon you to check our Site frequently to see recent changes.
